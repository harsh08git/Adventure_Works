# Adventure_Works

#### This repository showcases my end-to-end data analysis project using Microsoft Power BI Desktop on the Adventure Works dataset, a bicycle manufacturer and seller. The project encompasses data cleaning, modeling, and visualization to derive actionable insights. Notable features include the use of various DAX functions for in-depth analysis and the creation of impactful visualizations across four dedicated pages â€“ Executive Dashboard, Map, Product Detail, and Customer Detail. Explore the project to gain valuable insights into Adventure Works' sales and returns data.
